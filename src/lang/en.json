I went from being an ordinary developer to the head of the development team. During this time I have gained experience not only in programming, but also in database design, business analysis, automated testing, building workflows, developing standards and best practices, and of course managing a team of developers. Although I had great success in 1C, I wanted more: to go beyond the limits of a narrowly focused programming language, to study the global development practices. And here RSSchool came into my lifeðŸ™‚",
